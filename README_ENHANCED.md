- **No Algorithm**: Results sorted by actual popularity

## üéâ Summary

This enhanced version transforms YouTube search into a powerful, algorithm-free research tool. With smart intent detection, advanced filtering, and clickable URLs, you now have complete control over your content discovery - seeing what's actually popular, not what YouTube wants you to watch.

The tool treats YouTube as a library catalog rather than an engagement platform, giving you the power to find exactly what you're looking for without algorithmic interference.
